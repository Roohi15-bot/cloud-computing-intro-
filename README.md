# cloud computing intro (day 1)

definition- it's the deliver of computing services including servers,storage,databases,networking,software,and more-over the internet("the cloud").

the analogy-elecrtricity grid

instead of owning your own power generator(your own servers),you just plaug into a grid(the cloud) and pay for what you use

companies like microsoft(azure),amazon(AWS),and google(GCP)are the power plants

# Traditional IT vs. Cloud computing-

Traditiona; on-premise:

> you buy,own, and magae all your physical servers and infrasturcture

> you are responsible for maintaenance,power,cooling,and security

> high upfront costs(capital expenditure-CapEx)

> scaling up is slow and expensive

Cloud computing:

>you rent resources from a cloud provider

> pay-as-you-go model (operational expenditure-OpEx)

# key benefits of cloud computing 

this is the core "why" behind cloud adoption

>cost-effective- pay only for what you use,reducing capital expenses

>scalable-increase or decrease resouces based on demand

>elastic- automatically scale up or down as needed

>current- all underlying hardware and software is kept up-to-date by the provider.

>reliable- provides data backup disaster recovery and high

>global- deploy applications and data to datacenters all over the world.

# why cloud computing?

addresses key business problems:

1) speed & agility- develop and launch applications faster.instead of waiting weeks for a derver,you can provision one in minutes.

2) scalability- how do you handle sudden traffic spikes(eg., a viral marketing campaign)? the  loud can scale automatically.

3) global reach- easily deploy applications in multiple regions around the world to be closer to your customers.

4) cost savings-avoid the massive upfront cost of hardware and the ongoing cost of maintenance.
